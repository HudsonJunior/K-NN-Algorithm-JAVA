# K-NN Algorithm in Java

This project implements the **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm** in **Java** as part of an assignment for the **Object-Oriented Programming Paradigms** (OOPP) course. The algorithm performs data classification based on proximity to other points, introducing key concepts in machine learning.

## Overview

- **Purpose**: Utilizes K-NN for data classification tasks.
- **Language**: Java

This project provides hands-on experience with Java and foundational machine learning algorithms.
